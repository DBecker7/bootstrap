# The Bootstrap Method

Teaching materials for the bootstrap method.

The raw files are in `slides.qmd`. This creates both `slide.html` and `slides.pdf`.

If you clone the repo and view `slides.html`, you will see the presentation. However, `slides.pdf` also has something like my speaking notes and will be easier to digest.
